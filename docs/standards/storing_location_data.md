# Storing Location Data

Location sensors can provide several different channel types.

* latitude
* longitude
* altitude
* speed
* bearing
* horizontal_accuracy
* vertical_accuracy
* speed_accuracy
* bearing_accuracy

Each timestamp must correspond to exactly one of each channel type presented above.

Further, the location metadata should be populated to provide information on location permissions, user location requests, and location provider information.

Calculations for determining the best location metrics per packet are provided next.
