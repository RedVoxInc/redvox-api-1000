# Storing Location Data

* Location sensors can provide several different channel types: latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, bearing, horizontal_accuracy, vertical_accuracy, speed_accuracy, bearing_accuracy
* Each timestamp must correspond to exactly one of each channel type presented above.
* Further, the location metadata should be populated to provide information on location permissions, user location requests, and location provider information.
* Ensure statistics for timestamps and each location channel are maintained
* All location data should be relative to WGS 84
