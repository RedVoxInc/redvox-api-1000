# Storing Single Channel Data

These sensors utilize only a single channel to store their data. 
* Each sample must have an associated timestamp. 
* The length of samples must equal the length of timestamps. 
* A description of each sensor must be stored with the metadata. Be descriptive as possible.
* Keep both timestamp and sample statistics up to date.
